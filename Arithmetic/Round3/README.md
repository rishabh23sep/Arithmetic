## Round 3
### Aim
In this experiment the User will be able to understand the types of arithmetic operators in Go programming language and how to perform various arithmetic operations by using an interactive simulator.
### Theory
 <h3>Principle:</h3>
                   <div align="justify"> It involves the use of Go simulator implementing various arithmetic operations. Performing arithmetic operations on large numbers can be a difficult job to accomplish. This difficulty can be countered with the help of Go simulator that provides a friendly programming environment to the beginners, so that every new user can easily perform arithmetic operations and can implement in various Go programs. <br>
                    <h3>Theory of Arithmetic Operator:</h3>
                    Operators are the foundation of any programming language. Thus the functionality of the Go language is incomplete without the use of Arithmetic operators.<br>
                    These are used to perform arithmetic operations on operands in Go language:<br>
                    Addition: The ‘+’ operator adds two operands. For example, x+y.<br>
                    Subtraction: The ‘-‘ operator subtracts two operands. For example, x-y.<br>
                    Multiplication: The ‘*’ operator multiplies two operands. For example, x*y.<br>
                    Division: The ‘/’ operator divides the first operand by the second. For example, x/y.<br>  
                    
### Procedure
<h4>Steps of simulator :</h4>
                    1. Enter the First Number.<br>
                    2. Enter the Second Number.<br>
                    3. Select the operation.<br>
                    4. Click the Execute button to start the program.<br>
                    5. Click the next instruction button to scan each line of code.<br>
                    6. Click the reset button if you want to restart the simulator.<br>

### Pre Test
<dd>1. Arithmetic operators are usually-<br>
a.	Unary<br>
b.	Binary<br>
c.	Ternary<br>
d.	None of the Above<br></dd><br><br>
<dd>2.	Which of the following can be operands of arithmetic operators?<br>
a.	Numeric<br>
b.	Boolean<br>
c.	Characters<br>
d.	Both a & c
<br><br>
<dd>
 3. Is Go Language object oriented?<br>
a)	Yes<br>
b)	No<br>
c)	Can't say<br>
d)	None of these<br>
</dd>
               
        
### Post Test
<dd>1. Write a code to add two integers.<br>
    2. Write a code to find the area of a triangle.<br>
    3. Write a code to find the area of a rectangle.<br>
